		This library generates singleton types, promoted functions, and singleton
		functions using Template Haskell. It is useful for programmers who wish
		to use dependently typed programming techniques. The library was originally
		presented in /Dependently Typed Programming with Singletons/, published
		at the Haskell Symposium, 2012.
		(&lt;http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~eir/papers/2012/singletons/paper.pdf&gt;)
		Version 1.0 and onwards works a lot harder to promote functions. See the
		paper published at Haskell Symposium, 2014:
		&lt;http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~eir/papers/2014/promotion/promotion.pdf&gt;.
