ahyangyi-overlay
================

This Gentoo overlay is created and maintained by Yi Yang (ahyangyi@gmail.com).

Currently, it contains the following packages:

* A few Linley Henzell games, all based on Allegro 4.
* An alternative ebuild for lilypond, allowing the user to select between the default font and alternative Gonville font created by Simon Tatham, who is also the author of PuTTY and sgt-puzzles.
* An live ebuild for Youcompleteme. Currently broken again (should be fixed in near future).
* CÎ»ash, a functional hardware description language.
